        <p>
            Playground demonstrates diffrent kinds of modulation. You can specify signal and carry frequency. You are also allowed to
            pick sequence of bits. Any change in data input is reflected in chart.

        <p>
            BPSK stands for Binary Phase Shift Keying. It's a two phase modulation scheme. Binary message is represented by two phases
            states in carrier signal - 0&#176; for 1 and 180&#176; for 0.

        <c-header title="QPSK" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying#Quadrature_phase-shift_keying_(QPSK)"></c-header>
        <p>QPSK means Quadrature Phase Shift Keying. It is another variant of phase-shifting keying modulation. By constructing
            symbol with two bits, it can use a four different orthogonal values of the phase. Above digital modulation demo
            presents phases: &#x03A0;/4, 3&#x03A0;/4, 5&#x03A0;/4, 7&#x03A0;/4.

        <c-header title="QAM" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation"></c-header>
        <p>
            Quadrature amplitude modulation is both an analog and a digital modulation scheme. It conveys two analog message signals,
            or two digital bit streams, by modulating the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying
            (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves
            of the same frequency, usually sinusoids, are out of phase with each other by 90° and are thus called quadrature
            carriers or quadrature components — hence the name of the scheme. The modulated waves are summed, and the final
            waveform is a combination of both phase-shift keying (PSK) and amplitude-shift keying (ASK), or, in the analog
            case, of phase modulation (PM) and amplitude modulation.
            <br> QAM could modulates signal by using diffrent numbers of bits, for example 8-QAM uses 3 bits per symbol and 64-QAM
            uses 6 bits - hence the prefixes, because 2 raised to the power of 3 is 8 and to the power of 6 is 64.
            <br> In the playground, 8-QAM, 16-QAM and 64-QAM are implemented in their rectangular constellation instance.
